# kubectl alias
For your convenience, I wrote an alias so that instead of writing long commands, you can easily use the abbreviations of each of them, which you can see below, and even change the script according to your wishes.
```
kgp = kubectl get pods 
kr = kubectl roullout + "deployment/DEPLOYMENT_NAME"
kgs = kubecetl get services
and etc
```
